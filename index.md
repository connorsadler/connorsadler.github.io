### Latest work (September 2024 onwards)

I've been working on the following since being made redundant from Velo:

- Go learning
- Java refresher (as I've been doing Kotlin for a while)
- leetcode.com puzzles (Java) (profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/zebsmattz/))
- Hackerrank questions (Java)
- Kafka articles - I'm currently working on publishing some "Kafka in action" articles with Java and Spring Boot
