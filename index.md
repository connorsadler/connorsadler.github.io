### Latest work (September 2024 onwards)

I've been working on the following since being made redundant from Velo:

- Java refresher (as I've been doing Kotlin for a while)
- leetcode.com puzzles (Java) (profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/zebsmattz/))
- Hackerrank questions (Java)
- Kafka articles - I'm currently working on publishing some "Kafka in action" articles with Java and Spring Boot
- Go - tutorial/demo of how to use the 'cmd' pattern - see [here](https://github.com/connorsadler/go-cmd-sample)
- Go - tutorial/demo of how to create and reference a package from github - see [here](https://github.com/connorsadler/go-sample-module)
- Go - package to provide http logging when making outbound http calls from Go - [wip here - see branches](https://github.com/connorsadler/go-utils/)
