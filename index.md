### September 2024 approx

I've been working on the following since being made redundant from Velo:

- Java refresher (as I've been doing Kotlin for a while)
- leetcode.com puzzles (Java) (profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/zebsmattz/))
- Hackerrank questions (Java)
- Kafka articles - I'm currently working on publishing some "Kafka in action" articles with Java and Spring Boot
- Go - tutorial/demo of how to use the 'cmd' pattern - see [here](https://github.com/connorsadler/go-cmd-sample)
- Go - tutorial/demo of how to create and reference a package from github - see [here](https://github.com/connorsadler/go-sample-module)
- Go - package to provide http logging when making outbound http calls from Go - [here](https://github.com/connorsadler/go-utils/)
- Go - package to allow a Go Gmail api client program to make 'batch' calls - [here](https://github.com/connorsadler/go-utils/)
- Java - sorting algorithms - [here](https://github.com/connorsadler/public/tree/main/java/sorting-algorithms)

### October 2024
- More leetcode and algorithms in Java
- More Go work
- Google OAuth2 work - in order to access Gmail - includes work on Access tokens and Refresh tokens, uses a small http server to capture the callback from Google

### November 2024
- More leetcode coding in Java
- More Go learning
- Checked in Go POC for Gmail batching
- Work on a Go menu, to make developer workflows easier (I use a lot of bash menus in my workflow, this would replace/supplement them)
